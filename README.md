Clustering and Predictive Sequencing: Uncovering Criminal Profiles and Crime Type Connectivity

# Crime Pattern Analysis in Colorado Springs (2018-2023)

## Abstract
This study explores the application of clustering and sequential pattern mining to analyze and predict crime patterns in Colorado Springs from 2018 to 2023. Using K-means clustering, the research identifies four distinct demographic profiles related to criminal activities. Sequential Pattern Mining (SPM) further examines crime sequences and associations within these clusters. The study reveals significant crime patterns, such as correlations between driving under the influence and various offenses, and identifies potential areas for targeted crime prevention. Despite limitations like dataset regionality and temporal scope, the findings offer valuable insights for enhancing law enforcement strategies and public safety. The study aligns with SDGs 11 and 16, improving urban safety and reducing crime.

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a data analysis project focused on crime patterns in Colorado Springs, spanning 2018 to 2023. The project employs two main techniques:
- **K-means Clustering**: To identify demographic profiles associated with criminal activities.
- **Sequential Pattern Mining (SPM)**: To analyze sequences and associations of crimes within the identified clusters.

The project includes data preprocessing, model implementation, and a user-friendly application for predicting crime patterns based on demographic and crime-related inputs.

## Repository Structure
- **Arrest-Data-Preprocess-final.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook for preprocessing the raw crime dataset, filtering records from the last five years, cleaning data, and saving the processed dataset as `Processed_Arrest_Data_Final.csv`.
- **SPM-Clustering-Model-Application.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of K-means clustering, Sequential Pattern Mining, and a Tkinter-based application for crime pattern prediction.
- **Processed_Arrest_Data_Final.csv**: The preprocessed dataset used for analysis (not included in the repository due to size; generated by the preprocessing notebook).
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for use.

## Installation
To run the project, ensure you have Python 3.8 or later installed. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/crime-pattern-analysis.git
   cd crime-pattern-analysis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Install the required Python libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas mlxtend sklearn matplotlib tkinter
   ```

3. **Prepare the dataset**:
   - Run the `Arrest-Data-Preprocess-final.ipynb` notebook to preprocess the raw dataset (`Arrest Data.csv`) and generate `Processed_Arrest_Data_Final.csv`.
   - Ensure the raw dataset (`Arrest Data.csv`) is available in the repository directory or update the file path in the preprocessing notebook.

4. **Run the analysis and application**:
   - Open and execute the `SPM-Clustering-Model-Application.ipynb` notebook to perform clustering, SPM, and launch the Tkinter application.
   - The application allows users to select crime types and demographic attributes to predict associated crimes and cluster assignments.

## Usage
1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Execute the `Arrest-Data-Preprocess-final.ipynb` notebook to clean and filter the dataset. This step removes irrelevant columns, handles missing values, simplifies crime descriptions, and filters records from 2018 to 2023.
   - Output: `Processed_Arrest_Data_Final.csv`.

2. **Analysis and Visualization**:
   - Run the `SPM-Clustering-Model-Application.ipynb` notebook to:
     - Perform K-means clustering to identify demographic profiles.
     - Apply Sequential Pattern Mining to discover crime sequences and associations.
     - Visualize clustering results using scatter plots with principal components.
     - Evaluate the clustering model using Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index.

3. **Application**:
   - The notebook includes a Tkinter-based GUI (`SPMClusteringApp`) for interactive predictions.
   - Users can select a crime, age category, age range, race, gender, and ethnicity to predict:
     - **SPM Prediction**: The likely subsequent crime and its confidence score.
     - **Clustering Prediction**: The assigned cluster and its description.

## Key Findings
- **Clustering**: Identified four distinct demographic profiles associated with criminal activities in Colorado Springs.
- **Sequential Pattern Mining**: Uncovered significant crime associations, such as correlations between driving under the influence and other offenses.
- **Applications**: The findings can inform targeted crime prevention strategies and enhance public safety initiatives, aligning with SDGs 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) and 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions).

## Limitations
- **Dataset Regionality**: The analysis is limited to Colorado Springs, which may not generalize to other regions.
- **Temporal Scope**: The dataset covers 2018â€“2023, potentially missing longer-term trends.
- **Data Quality**: Missing values and inconsistencies in the original dataset may affect results.
